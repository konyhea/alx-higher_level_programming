# Project Exceptions

Error handling in Python involves managing and responding to exceptions that may occur during the execution of a program. Exceptions are unexpected events that disrupt the normal flow of the program's execution. Python provides mechanisms for detecting and handling these exceptions, allowing developers to gracefully manage errors and prevent program crashes.

In Python, exceptions are events that occur during the execution of a program that disrupt the normal flow of the program's instructions. These exceptions can be handled using the <mark> try and except </mark>onstruct, allowing developers to gracefully manage errors and prevent program crashes.

## Error Handling with Try and Except

When writing Python code, it's essential to handle errors gracefully using the `try` and `except` blocks. This allows you to anticipate and handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of your code.

### Syntax

The basic syntax for using `try` and `except` in Python is as follows:

```python
try:
    # Code block where exceptions may occur
    # This is the code you want to monitor for errors
except ExceptionType:
    # Code block to handle the exception
    # This block is executed if an exception of type ExceptionType occurs

try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / x
    print("Result:", result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero!")
