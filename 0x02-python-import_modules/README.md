# Python Modules, Import, and Command Line Usage

## Introduction

Python is a powerful programming language known for its simplicity and readability. In Python, code organization is achieved through the use of modules, importing functionalities from other files, and command line execution.

## Modules

In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. These files have a `.py` extension and can contain classes, functions, and variables. Modules allow you to organize your code into logical units, making it easier to manage and reuse.

## Import

Python provides the `import` statement to access code defined in modules. With `import`, you can bring in functions, classes, or variables defined in other Python files into your current script or module. Here's a basic usage:

```python
# Importing the whole module
import module_name

# Importing specific items from a module
from module_name import item1, item2
